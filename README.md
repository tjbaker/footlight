clips for Reels / TikTok / YouTube Shorts. A thin wrapper around <code>ffmpeg</code>.

## Philosophy — control-first, not auto-magic

Footlight automates the *mechanical* part of vertical clipping — **cut → crop →
scale → encode** — **after** a human has made the creative decisions: which
moment to clip and where to frame it. It does **not** try to pick moments for
you.

This is deliberate. Transcript-based auto-clippers (Opus Clip, Klap, and the
like) decide what to clip by reading speech, so they are built for talking-head
content and fall apart on instrumental and live-performance footage where there
is no transcript to key off. Footlight serves that underserved case: **music and
live performance**, where the editor already knows the moment and the subject
moves across the frame. You make the calls; Footlight does the rendering.

## Status

This is an early build. Footlight is a **TypeScript render engine + CLI** with a
**desktop GUI** (Tauri) for visual frame-accurate cutting and crop authoring —
including punch-in/zoom framing and **optional AI-assisted subject tracking**
(provider-agnostic, with Gemini as the reference vision provider) as an opt-in
accelerant, never a gate. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the design rationale; the
roadmap lives in [issues](https://github.com/tjbaker/footlight/issues) and
[releases](https://github.com/tjbaker/footlight/releases).

You **run it from source** — there is no prebuilt/signed download. The browser
GUI needs only Node; the native window additionally needs the Rust toolchain.
See **[Running Footlight](#running-footlight)** below.

## Requirements

- **`ffmpeg`** and **`ffprobe`** — e.g. `brew install ffmpeg`. Footlight invokes
  these to do all cut/crop/scale/encode work. **Burned captions** additionally
  need an ffmpeg built with **libass** (the `subtitles` filter); minimal
  builds omit it — `make doctor` reports whether yours has it, and on macOS
  `brew install homebrew-ffmpeg/ffmpeg/ffmpeg` provides a build that does
  (verify with `ffmpeg -filters | grep -E 'ass|subtitles'`).
- **Node 26+**
- **`yt-dlp`** (optional) — for downloading source footage, e.g.
  `brew install yt-dlp`.
- **Rust toolchain** (optional) — only for the *native* desktop window
  (`make tauri-dev`). Install via <https://rustup.rs>. The browser GUI and the
  CLI do not need it.

Footlight does **not** bundle ffmpeg/ffprobe/Node — it invokes whatever is on
your `PATH`. Run **`make doctor`** to verify your environment in one shot. On
**macOS**, **`make setup-system`** installs the system tools (ffmpeg, yt-dlp) via
Homebrew; on other platforms, `make doctor` prints the exact install command for
anything missing.

## Getting started

From zero to your first vertical clip:

1. **Install the prerequisites** — `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and Node 26+
   (see [Requirements](#requirements)). On **macOS**, `make setup-system`
   installs ffmpeg + yt-dlp via Homebrew.
2. **Set up and verify your environment:**
   ```bash
   make setup     # install all dependencies (root engine + GUI)
   make doctor    # verify Node 26+, ffmpeg, ffprobe are on PATH
   ```
3. **Launch the GUI in your browser** (no Rust needed):
   ```bash
   make gui
   ```
   This starts the dev backend (ffmpeg/ffprobe/CLI on :8787) and the Vite
   frontend together; open the printed localhost URL. Ctrl-C stops both.
4. **Cut your first clip:**
   - **Load** a source — Browse…, drag a video onto the window, or paste a path.
   - **Drag across the loudness timeline** to set In / Out.
   - **Frame** with the orange 9:16 box — drag to move, drag a corner to punch in.
   - **Add clip → queue**, choose a **Destination**, and **Render**.

Your clip lands in the Destination folder. Prefer a native window or the command
line? See **Running Footlight** and **CLI usage** below.

## Running Footlight

Everything is driven by `make` (run `make help` for the full list). The browser
GUI (`make gui`) is covered in **[Getting started](#getting-started)**; for a
native desktop window, with the Rust toolchain installed:

```bash
make tauri-dev     # native desktop window (hot-reloads)
make tauri-build   # build a local .app  (UNSIGNED — local use only)
```

> **No signed distribution.** `make tauri-build` produces an **unsigned** `.app`
> under `app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`. Build it on the Mac that will run
> it; to run it on another Mac, launch with **right-click → Open** (or clear the
> quarantine flag: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Footlight.app`). That
> machine still needs ffmpeg/ffprobe/Node on `PATH` — `make doctor` checks.

The CLI is also available directly after `make build` — see **CLI usage** below.

## The desktop app

`make gui` (browser) or `make tauri-dev` (native) opens a frame-accurate cutter:

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/footlight-dark-annotated.png">
    <img alt="Annotated Footlight editor: the 9:16 crop box (drag to reframe), the live 9:16 output preview, and the loudness timeline that flags quiet-to-loud swells" src="docs/images/footlight-light-annotated.png" width="900">
  </picture>
</p>

- **Load** a source — Browse…, drag a video onto the window, or paste a path.
- **Loudness timeline** is the scrubber/trimmer: **drag across it to set In/Out**,
  click to seek, hover to preview frames. It draws volume over time with suggested
  quiet→loud **swells**, plus scene-cut ticks and ⏮ / ⏭ cut-jumps (scenes are
  auto-detected on load).
- **Frame** with the orange 9:16 box — drag to reposition, drag a **corner to
  punch in / zoom**, double-click to reset. A live **9:16 output preview** (with
  optional social safe-area guides) shows the actual vertical result as you frame.
- **Moving crop:** drop **keyframes** for a time-keyed schedule that hard-switches
  the crop at cuts.
- **Auto-track** (optional, BYOK): AI subject tracking builds a smooth eased crop
  path across one shot — a reviewable suggestion. Add a Gemini key in **Settings**
  (stored in your OS keychain), or set **`GEMINI_API_KEY`** in your environment /
  `.env` — the env var works for the CLI and `make gui` and takes precedence over a
  stored key (see `.env.example`). AI is entirely optional; the core never needs a key.
- **Add clip → queue** (editable: click a card to re-edit, drag to reorder,
  duplicate), choose a **Destination**, and **Render**. Past renders are saved to
  **History** for one-click re-framing; your working session is autosaved and
  restored on next launch.
- **Keyboard-driven** — Space, ← / →, I / O, [ / ], S, and more; press **?** for
  the shortcuts overlay.

In-app **Help → User Guide** documents all of this.

## CLI usage

```bash
# Render every clip described in a manifest (CSV or JSON).
footlight render manifest.csv|.json [--outdir clips] [--crf 19] [--preset medium] \
                                    [--audio-bitrate copy] [--dry-run] \
                                    [--burn-captions [--caption-font <path|name>] \
                                      [--caption-color #RRGGBB] [--caption-outline-color #RRGGBB] \

```

### `render` flags

| flag | default | meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--outdir` | `clips` | output directory for rendered clips |
| `--crf` | `19` | H.264 quality; lower = better / larger |
| `--preset` | `medium` | x264 speed/efficiency preset |
| `--audio-bitrate` | `copy` | `copy` passes the source audio through losslessly (no re-encode, no resample); pass an AAC bitrate like `256k` only to force a re-encode |
| `--dry-run` | off | print the `ffmpeg` commands without running them |
| `--burn-captions` | off | burn each clip's `hook` / `title` into the video (clips export clean by default — see [Captions](#captions-optional)) |
| `--caption-font` | system sans | caption font: a `.ttf` / `.otf` file path **or** a fontconfig family name (only with `--burn-captions`) |
| `--caption-color` | `#FFFFFF` | caption fill color, `#RRGGBB` (only with `--burn-captions`) |
| `--caption-outline-color` | `#000000` | caption outline color, `#RRGGBB` (only with `--burn-captions`) |
| `--caption-bold` | off | render captions **bold** (only with `--burn-captions`) |
| `--caption-italic` | off | render captions *italic* (only with `--burn-captions`) |
| `--caption-underline` | off | underline captions (only with `--burn-captions`) |

`probe` reports the source's dimensions and a `cropdetect` content-region
suggestion. `scenes` reports detected cut timestamps you can use as switch points
in a time-keyed `crop_offset` schedule.

## CSV schema

The manifest is the source of truth: **one row per clip.**

| column | required | meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `source_file` | yes | path to the source video |
| `in_point` | yes | start timestamp — `HH:MM:SS`, `MM:SS`, or seconds |
| `out_point` | yes | end timestamp — same formats |
| `crop_offset` | defaults `center` | horizontal framing: `left` / `center` / `right`, an integer x-pixel offset (from the left edge, clamped into frame), **or** a time-keyed schedule like `0=center; 14.5=440` |
| `content_crop` | optional | `W:H:X:Y` region cropped *first* to strip letterbox/pillarbox bars; crop offsets then become relative to it |
| `out_name` | optional | output filename; auto-generated from source + timestamps if blank |
| `hook` | optional | caption: the big headline line (see [Captions](#captions-optional)) |
| `title` | optional | caption: the secondary line below the hook |
| `text_position` | defaults `bottom` | caption placement: `top` / `center` / `bottom` |

The `hook` / `title` / `text_position` fields carry your caption shot-list with the
manifest. Clips export **clean by default** — these are only burned in when you pass
`--burn-captions`. See **[Captions](#captions-optional)**.

**JSON manifests.** Pass a `.json` array of the same clip objects instead of a CSV
to use two fields CSV can't express: **`cropWindow`** (an explicit 9:16
punch-in/zoom window) and **`cropPath`** (an eased subject-tracking crop path).
The GUI writes these for you; render precedence is `cropPath` → `cropWindow` →
`crop_offset`.

### Why `crop_offset` is per-clip

A one-man-band moves across the frame between instruments, so a fixed center crop
cuts off the action. Each clip sets its own horizontal framing. `left` /
`center` / `right` cover most cases; a numeric x-pixel offset gives fine control
between them.

For **edited / multi-shot sources** (a music video that cuts between angles),
give `crop_offset` a **time-keyed schedule** like `0=center; 14.5=440`. The crop
x **hard-switches** at each clip-relative time. Align those switch times to the
source's own cuts (use `footlight scenes`) and the change is invisible. For clips
with heavy continuous movement *within a single shot*, Footlight's optional
**auto-track** (AI, opt-in, BYOK) builds a smooth eased crop path that follows the
subject — a reviewable suggestion you edit before rendering (see
[SPEC.md](SPEC.md) §6.9).

## Captions (optional)

Clips export **clean — no burned-in text — by default.** Captions are **opt-in**.

The intent is to keep your headline text *native*: typed into Reels / TikTok /
Shorts where each platform renders it, so it stays editable and dodges the ranking
penalty those platforms apply to non-native, baked-in text. Burn captions only when
you specifically need them in the pixels (a download, a cross-post, a platform
without a text tool).

You still describe captions per clip in the manifest, so the shot-list travels with
the cut even when nothing is burned:

| field | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `hook` | the big headline line |
| `title` | the secondary line, set below the hook |
| `text_position` | `top` / `center` / `bottom` (default `bottom`) |

To actually burn them into the video, add `--burn-captions` at render time:

```bash
# Clean clips (default) — manifest carries hook/title as a shot-list, nothing burned.
footlight render manifest.csv

# Burn the captions in, using the system default sans-serif.
footlight render manifest.csv --burn-captions

# Burn with your own font — a .ttf/.otf file path…
footlight render manifest.csv --burn-captions --caption-font ./fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf

# …or a fontconfig family name already installed on the system.
footlight render manifest.csv --burn-captions --caption-font "Helvetica Neue"

# Style the burned text — fill/outline color (#RRGGBB) and bold/italic/underline.
footlight render manifest.csv --burn-captions \
  --caption-color "#FFE600" --caption-outline-color "#101010" --caption-bold
```

**Bring your own font.** Captions are bring-your-own-font and **local-first** —
Footlight bundles **no** caption font and never downloads one. The right caption
type is a creative choice, not a one-size-fits-all default. `--caption-font` takes
either a `.ttf` / `.otf` **file path** or a **fontconfig family name**: a path uses
that exact font file (Footlight resolves its real family name so `libass` renders it
correctly), while a name picks an installed family. With `--burn-captions` and no
`--caption-font`, the system default sans is used, which requires an `ffmpeg` built
**with fontconfig**.

**Choosing a font in the app.** Settings → Rendering → Captions has a font picker
with three ways to choose, all local — nothing is fetched:

- **System fonts** — any font installed on your machine. Footlight enumerates them
  automatically and lists them under a *System fonts* group.
- **Fonts folder** — point Footlight at a directory of your own `.ttf` / `.otf` /
  `.ttc` files (Browse on the desktop app, or type the path on the browser build).
  Those show up in a *Your fonts* group pinned to the top of the picker for quick
  access — drop a font in the folder and it appears.
- **Custom path…** — the escape hatch for a single one-off font file.

**Style.** Captions render `hook` above `title` as one centered block, with the hook
at roughly `h/18` and the title at `h/26` of the 1080×1920 output, inset by ~12%
top/bottom safe margins. The burned text (via the `libass` renderer) can be styled:

- **Fill color** and **outline color** as `#RRGGBB` — `--caption-color` /
  `--caption-outline-color`.
- **Bold**, **italic**, **underline** — `--caption-bold` / `--caption-italic` /
  `--caption-underline`.

In the app these live under **Settings → Rendering → Captions** as a small text
toolbar: two color inputs plus B / I / U toggles. Defaults are unchanged — white
fill, black outline, no bold/italic/underline — so existing manifests render exactly
as before. More styling (position, rotation, shadow) is on the roadmap.

## Audio

Audio is **copied losslessly by default** (`-c:a copy`): the source track is
passed through untouched — same codec, bitrate, and sample rate — so the encode
never adds a compression generation or resamples. **The source is the quality
ceiling** (YouTube tops out around 128k AAC / 140k Opus); re-encoding to a higher
bitrate would only pad it. Pass `--audio-bitrate 256k` only when you genuinely
need a re-encode (e.g. a frame-exact audio cut on a downbeat).

## Framing gotchas

> **`cropdetect` sees black bars only.** Colored or blurred-banner pillarboxing
> is invisible to it — a source can look full-frame to `footlight probe` while the
> real performance sits in a narrower center region with decorative side banners.
> A `left` / `right` crop relative to the full frame will then land on dead bars.

The framing call is **human**. Verify on the actual frames:

- For pillarboxed sources, use `center` (or a numeric `crop_offset` bounded to the
  content region), and/or set `content_crop` to the real content region so offsets
  become relative to it.
- Don't trust title/resolution/view-count metadata to judge usable footage — it
  cannot see the pixels.

To pre-screen a downloaded file's content bounds (black bars only):

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 60 -i FILE -vf cropdetect=limit=24:round=2 -frames:v 300 -f null -
```

…then read the suggested `crop=` value. `footlight probe` surfaces the same
suggestion.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — and not only code. Footlight has **two contribution
surfaces**: the render engine / CLI / GUI, and the **"framing brain"**
(`prompts/base.md`) — the prose that encodes framing domain knowledge. A newly
discovered pillarbox trap or a crop recipe for a new source type makes a valuable
prose-only PR, no code required. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.
